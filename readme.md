# Project #4: Your "Capstone" Project

## Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date.

**Before you start working** on the planning for your project, be sure to review your idea with an instructor to ensure that it both:

- **Meets the minimum requirements**, and
- **Is reasonably scoped**

## Project Requirements

### Planning Requirements

As you've discovered, a project consists of more than just code.

This project requires **planning** organized within a **Trello board** with the following **lists**:

☐ **Icebox**: Holds user stories that have yet to be moved to the _Current/MVP_ list. All user stories are originally put into the _Icebox_, including both MVP and wish list stories. 

☐ **Current/MVP**: Holds user stories that must be completed to meet the minimum project requirements (MVP). Once the MVP has been met, additional user stories may be moved to this list from the _Icebox_.

☐ **Completed**: Holds completed user stories. 

☐ **Wireframes**: Sketches of each screens's user interface for the major functionality of the application.

☐ **Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD)**: A diagram of the app's models (one per data entity) and the relationships between them.

> Important: User stories need to be formed properly using this template:<br>`As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>`.<br>The _reason_ is optional if it's patently obvious.


### Version Control Requirements

☐ The project's source code must be hosted on a personal **GitHub repository**.

☐ The repo is to contain **frequent commits** dated from the beginning of the project through its completion. Do not "start over" by replacing the repository with a different one.

### README Requirements

Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted `README.md`.

The `README.md` introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!


Include the following sections within the **`README.md`**:

☐ **App Title:** Contains a description of what the app does and optional background info.
  
☐ **Screenshot(s):** A screenshot of your app's landing page and any other screenshots of interest.
  
☐ **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used.
    
☐ **Getting Started**: That Includes:
  	
<!-- - A link to the **deployed app** (Heroku) -->
- A link to the **Trello board** used for the project's planning that includes user stories, wireframes & an ERD.
  
☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).
> Note: Do include project planning (user stories, wireframes and ERDs) in the `README.md`.
  
### Technical Requirements

☐ A **working** full-stack application
<!-- , single-page application hosted on Heroku. -->

☐ Incorporate the technologies of the **MERN-stack** or **Python/Django**

<!-- - MongoDB/Mongoose or Postgres/Django's ORM
- Express or Django
- React or Django's DTL
- Node or Python -->

☐ **Have a well-styled interactive front-end**.

<!-- ☐ Communicates with the **Express** backend via AJAX. -->

☐ Implement **authentication**.  Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out.

☐ Implement **authorization** by restricting CUD data functionality to authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.

☐ **Have a well-scoped feature-set**. Full-CRUD data operations are required for 3 models, other than user model.
	
###  Bonus

- Consume data from a third-party API.
- Implement additional functionality if the user is an admin.
- Utilize multi-user, real-time communications (beware that this is difficult and time consuming - please seek instructor approval).


## Necessary Deliverables
- Projects are due on Thursday, 14th Nov 2024 at 09.30am!
- You have to fill the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cyK8wmfJE3aJK8pxKUnFGh2kBUyCBmv3/edit?gid=2112355843#gid=2112355843) with you name, github links and deployed link.
- A **working app**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo


## Self-sufficiency / Project Assistance

- At this stage of SEI, being able to find the the answers to development issues is of paramount importance. 

- Use all resources available to solve the issue on your own before seeking assistance.

- If you do seek assistance in Slack, explain the issue as clearly and detailed as you can, include screenshots when possible, and be prepared to explain what you've done to solve the issue on your own.

## Suggestions to Get Started

- Create two separate repositories for frontend application and backend application. Both repositories will have their own readme files (MERN).

- Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features – simple is better. Favor fewer features that look/feel impressive over numerous clunky/sloppy features.

- Because it takes longer to code user interfaces using React than with EJS & DTL, be sure to prioritize user stories to meet the MVP and ice box the others.

- Implement the `User` model and authentication first. Then implement the "As a visitor, when I browse to the app, I want..." user story.

- Follow the steps we've done in class to implement features, beginning with the user's interaction, identifying the proper route, etc. 

- Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use.

<!-- ## Best Practices

- In a SPA, communication with the backend is via AJAX.  Use **RESTful API routing to CRUD your data entities (resources)**.  In addition to CRUD functionality, be sure to perform other functionality, e.g., logging in, via AJAX as well.

- **Be consistent** with your code style.

- **Clearly name variables and functions** - remember, variables are usually named as **nouns** and functions as **verbs**.

- **Write well-formatted JS & CSS.** Properly formatting your code makes it more readable. Improperly formatted code infers sloppiness.

- **Comment your code where it makes sense to do so**. Most code is self-documenting (don't comment the obvious), however, use comments to explain complicated code. -->
